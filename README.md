# RedditRPC
Reddit integrated with the Discord Rich Presence.

This project is not supported and created by Reddit.

This application opens the web version of the new Reddit website and performs background operations to collect data from the current subreddit, the post you are viewing. It does not use the Reddit API, everything is collected from the DOM itself.

Shows status on Discord.


# Installation
1. Download the correct release for your operating system. (**exe** = Windows, **dmg** = MacOS, **AppImage** = Linux)
2. Install the application that you have downloaded.

# Usage
When opening the app for the first time, you will have to login with your Reddit account. **IT'S THE OFFICIAL REDDIT PAGE, THIS APPLICATION NOT COLLECT ANY DATA FROM THE USERS.**

Discord needs to be running for rich presence to work, otherwise you will have to reopen the application.

Update of rich presence is automatic, does not require any user action.
