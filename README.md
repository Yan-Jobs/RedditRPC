# RedditRPC
Reddit integrated with the Discord Rich Presence.

This project is not supported and created by Reddit.

This application opens the web version of the new Reddit website and performs background operations to collect data from the current subreddit, the post you are viewing. It does not use the Reddit API, everything is collected from the DOM itself.

Shows status on Discord.

# Installation
1. Download the correct release for your operating system. (**exe** = Windows, **dmg** = MacOS, **AppImage** = Linux)
2. Install the application that you have downloaded.

# Usage
When opening the app you can either choose to log in or browse Reddit disconnected **IT'S THE OFFICIAL REDDIT PAGE, THIS APPLICATION NOT COLLECT ANY DATA FROM THE USERS**, so you can safely log in :) !

Discord needs to be running for rich presence to work, otherwise you will have to reopen the application.

Update of rich presence is automatic, does not require any user action.

# Credits
This project is not (just) a recomposition of [DeezerRPC](https://github.com/Braasileiro/DeezerRPC) by [Braasileiro](https://github.com/Braasileiro), it took me a long time to figure out how to integrate it with Reddit. But thanks to him for the base code which I used as a reference, and helped me a lot !
